Kubeacct.py

- This program retrieves data from prometheus based on what you enter in the command line. 
	- --p followed by a period: "1h", "1d", "5m", etc speciefies over what range to retrieve the data.
	-  then specify what data you want.
		- -g: gpu
			- if --requested is added, the requested number of gpus will be displayed. Otherwise the total usage will be displayed.
		- -c: cpu
			- if --requested is added, the requested number of cpus will be displayed. Otherwise the total usage will be displayed.
		- -w: wallclock time
		- -m: memory
		- -n: network
			- if --transmit is added the transmitted network will be displayed instead of the default received.
	- -o followed by a time ("1w", "30d", etc), is the offset and will cause the program to retrieve the data from that much time in the past.
		- in our experience adding an offset whiile trying to find network data will most likely fail.
	- i.e: $ python kubeacct.py -p "1h" -g -o "1w" 
		- This retrieves the total gpu usage a week ago from the query time over a 1 hour period.
	- -s followed by either "0" or "1" tells the program how to sort the data.
		- "0": alphebetically
		- "1": numerically in descending order.
			- if you want to reverse the order (meaning ascending or starting with z, add -r)
	- the program automatically converts the data into proper units and doesn't diplay namespaces whose according value is 0.
		- -all displays all namespaces without filtering out the 0's.
		- -u followed by a unit ("s", "ks", "Gs", etc.) forces a conversion to the specified unit
	- i.e $ python kubeacct.py -p "24h" -c --requested -s "0" -u "Ms"
		- gets the total cpus requested in the last 24 for each namespaces, sorted alphabetically, and in Ms.
